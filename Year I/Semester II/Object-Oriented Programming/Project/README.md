# Project Details
The project consisted of exemplifying OOP concepts learned throughout the course, by writing a C++ program, that manages a real-life situation: the management of an airline/store/restaurant/etc.
I chose to make a project about the management of a store that provides PC and laptop related products, as well as services.
