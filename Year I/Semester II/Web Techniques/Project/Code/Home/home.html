            Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 Series Shortage Likely to Continue to 2022
          </p>
          <img src="nvidia-30-series-shortage-2021.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            A new report says that Nvidia's 30 Series of graphics cards will
            remain in severely limited supply for some time, even through 2021.
            <br />
            <br />
            The rollout of Nvidia's 30 Series of graphics cards has been
            challenging for all parties involved, to say the least. Despite
            initial 30 Series cards releasing as far back as September 2020, no
            card in the line is in stock as of March 2021. Further, Nvidia 30
            Series card shipments continue to sell out near-instantly, only for
            resale cards to appear on eBay and other grey markets with their
            prices raised to the extreme. As if the status quo wasn't bad
            enough, it's being reported that shortages should be expected
            through 2021. A new report from Digitimes claims that 30 Series
            cards are going to remain in short supply through the third quarter
            of 2021. A specific reason for continued shortages isn't provided,
            but there are references made to Nvidia's issues supplying specific
            components required to produce 30 Series cards. Specifically, that
            Samsung is struggling to create enough graphics circuits to meet the
            demands of Nvidia for its 30 Series graphics cards.

          <p>AMD Ryzen 7 5800H</p>
          <img src="2021-02-06-image-10-j.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            The Ryzen 7 5800H is another new Zen 3-based APU that will form the
            backbone of AMD’s gaming laptop platform and like the 4800H before
            it, it is expected to be the most popular processor in the series
            and found in a wide variety of laptop models.
            <br />
            <br />
            The new processor features an unlocked 8 core, 16 thread design with
            16 MB of L3 cache. On the CPU, we’re looking at a 3.2 GHz base clock
            and 4.4 GHz boost, and it’s really just in these clock speeds where
            the 5800H sits below the flagship 5900HX and 5980HX. On the GPU side
            we’re getting an unlocked Vega design, with 8 compute units enabled
            clocked up to 2.0 GHz.

            Intel Xe graphics: What you need to know about Intel’s dedicated
            GPUs
          </p>
          <img src="xe-2-720x720.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Intel is back in the graphics game after a nearly 20-year hiatus.
            Originally announced for a 2020 release, Intel’s Xe graphics will be
            the first add-in GPU Intel has produced since 1998, and we expect to
            see them this year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Intel originally stated that we can expect a summer 2020 debut and
            that it was targeting a broad selection of graphics options for the
            mainstream, gamers, professionals, and data centers. 2020 has come
            and gone, though, so now Intel is targeting a 2021 release.
            <br />
            <br />
            The technology behind this GPU and its potential performance remain
            shrouded in mystery, but as time goes on, details are coming to
            light. If it proves a viable alternative to Nvidia and AMD, this
            will be one of the most important events in the graphics card
            industry this century.
