# Project Details
The project consisted of creating a web app, by using the shiny package for the R language, in RStudio. The theme of the project that me and my team have chosen is the implementation of a 2D Chaos Game. The project had to contain a report, written in R Markdown, including all of the simulations, figures, and lines of code inside the app.

This project was realized in a group of three students.
