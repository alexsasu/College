          <td>CPU</td>
          <td>
            Central Processing Unit - The electronic circuitry that executes
            instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic
            arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations
            specified by the instructions in the program.

        <tr>
          <td>Clock Speed</td>
          <td>
            Clock speed - The rate at which a processor can complete a
            processing cycle. It is typically measured in megahertz or
            gigahertz. One megahertz is equal to one million cycles per second,
            while one gigahertz equals one billion cycles per second. This means
            a 1.8 GHz processor has twice the clock speed of a 900 MHz
            processor. However, it is important to note that a 1.8 GHz CPU is
            not necessarily twice as fast as a 900 MHz CPU. This is because
            different processors often use different architectures. For example,
            one processor may require more clock cycles to complete a
            multiplication instruction than another processor.

          <td>GPU</td>
          <td>
            Graphics Processing Unit - The physical "chip" (a semiconductor)
            that performs all graphics computations in a system. A GPU is
            comprised of a silicon processor - not unlike a CPU - atop a
            substrate, which is then mounted to the host video card (or directly
            to the motherboard, in the case of laptops, tablets, and phones).
            Modern CPUs will also contain an "IGP," or Integrated Graphics
            Processor, which is effectively a compartmentalized GPU that shares
            chip space with the CPU.

        <tr>
          <td>Memory Bandwidth (GPU)</td>
          <td>
            Memory Bandwidth (GPU) - Memory bandwidth is one of the most
            frequently showcased stats for any new GPU, often rating in hundreds
            of gigabytes per second of throughput potential. Memory Bandwidth is
            the theoretical maximum amount of data that the bus can handle at
            any given time, playing a determining role in how quickly a GPU can
            access and utilize its framebuffer.

        <tr>
          <td>Memory Interface</td>
          <td>
            Memory Interface - There are several memory interfaces throughout a
            computer system. As it pertains to the GPU, a Memory Interface is
            the physical bit-width of the memory bus. Every clock cycle
            (billions per second), data is transferred along a memory bus to and
            from the on-card memory. The width of this interface, normally
            defined as "384-bit" or similar, is the physical count of bits that
            can fit down the bus per clock cycle. A device with a 384-bit memory
            interface would be able to transfer 384 bits of data per clock cycle
            (there are 8 bits in a Byte). The memory interface is also a
            critical component of the memory bandwidth calculation in
            determining maximum memory throughput on a GPU.

        <tr>
          <td>CUDA Cores</td>
          <td>
            CUDA Cores - Just a small part of the larger whole when it comes to
            an nVidia GPU. A "CUDA Core" is nVidia's equivalent to AMD's "Stream
            Processors." NVidia's proprietary parallel computing programming
            model, CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), is a specialized
            programming language that can leverage the GPU in specific ways to
            perform tasks with greater performance. Each GPU can contain
            hundreds to thousands of CUDA cores. Architecture changes in a
            fashion that makes cross-generation comparisons often non-linear,
            but generally speaking (within a generation), more CUDA cores will
            equate more raw compute power from the GPU. The Kepler to Maxwell
            architecture jump saw nearly a 40% efficiency gain in CUDA core
            processing ability, illustrating the difficulty of linearly drawing
            comparisons without proper benchmarks.

          <td>RAM</td>
          <td>
            Random-Access Memory - A form of computer memory that can be read
            and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and
            machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be
            read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of
            the physical location of data inside the memory.
